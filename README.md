# text_data_augmentation
This repository implements various Data Augmentation techniques in NLP.

In text classification, we often face the challenge of class imbalance. In such cases its quite difficult to get good results by training the algorithm directly on the imbalanced data.

In most of the cases in NLP, techniques like SMOTE doesnt work well.

One of the best and successfull ways to solve this problems is by using data augmentation techniques.

This repo uses nlpaug python library => https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug

This work is highly inspired by this great article : https://amitness.com/2020/05/data-augmentation-for-nlp/
